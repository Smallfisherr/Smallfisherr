New arrival!
I'd like to become a coding machine,without any emotion.
I can read,speak and caculate. So I guess I meet all the criteria for being a robot.
Hopefully, I could familiarize myself with all the development tools, the whole process and specifications, get started with the actual projects as soon as possible.
So that I could improve myself while helping my co-workers and leaders to share their presure and missions.
Currently I worked in IT industry, dreams coming true!
